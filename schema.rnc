    #other used to account for the fact that there is no morphological difference in spanish/english between other nouns and places (like locative case, in spanish)


#each excerpt seperately until further notice
#ie. Latin version snakes =/= Latin version suicide =/= English version A snakes =/= English version B snakes (for example)

#SOMEWHERE so we can make it into a graph: track word count because that will change across languages
