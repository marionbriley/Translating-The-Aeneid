# April 2 Meeting Notes

Agammemnon was a terrible person
So was Odysseus

The semester's almost over and that's fun and terrifying

What guidelines for background/How much detail do we go into?

We have pages on the website!

XSLT will start up soon

Add translator (and project member?) info to the page holding the excerpt itself, as well as on the Sources page

bar graphs in analysis for visual comparison of grammatical and stylistic features

Tuesday meeting
- more detail for xml
