# Meeting Notes
## March 5, 2019

Started markup on English, Spanish, and German (no Latin yet- that's on paper at the moment)

Remember: when starting markup, associate schema before all

add line number attribute

Markup done by Thursday back

Start HTML after that

Spend week after break focused on bare-bones structure of site (the pages and their basic content) (that meeting's topic)

work on placeholder page tonight
