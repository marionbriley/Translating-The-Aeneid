### Research Question
Investigate the different linguistic choices translators make in order to translate passages of *The Aeneid*.

### Sections
**We are planning to compare translations of various iconic moments, rather than attempting to work with the entire epic poem.**
* Aeneas' "Forsan et haec.." Speech _(Book 1: roughly lines 195-207)_
* Laoc√∂on and the Snakes _(Book 2: roughly lines 195-233)_
* Dido's Suicide _(Book 4: roughly lines 296-361)_
* Cumaean Sibyl? _(If we have time...Book 6)_

### Languages
* Latin _(original - Marion and Kalan)_
* English _(Maybe through Perseus? Must find a non-copywrited version)_
* Spanish _(Several non-copywrited versions available through Pitt library system and University of Madrid Archives, must decide version - Marion)_
* German _(Must find a non-copywrited version - Sarah and Kalan)_
* French? _(If time - Kalan)_
