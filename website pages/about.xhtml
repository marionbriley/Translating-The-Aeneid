            <h3>The History of Vergil's <em>Aeneid</em> and Its Cultural Impact</h3>
            <p/>
            <p> The <em>Aeneid</em> is a twelve book long epic poem composed by the Roman poet
                Vergil in the 1st century BCE. It was designed as a successor to the <em>Iliad</em>
                and the <em>Odyssey</em> written by the Greek poet Homer around 700 years earlier in
                the 8th century BCE. However, instead of following the Greek heroes of Odysseus,
                Achilles, Agamemnon, and company, Vergil adopts the Trojan Aeneas to portray the
                legendary journey of the forefathers of Rome to the Italian peninsula. Vergil’s
                masterpiece quickly joined the pinnacles of Latin literature, and it has remained a
                centerpiece of study for classicists, literary scholars, and historians.</p>
            <p> The <em>Aeneid</em> has secured itself as a strong center of cultural significance.
                In 1944, T.S. Eliot described the <em>Aeneid</em> as 'the classic of all Europe'
                stemming from its rich political history and the persisting relevance of Vergil. In
                addition to the great tale it tells, the <em>Aeneid</em> also indicates the
                historical state of Rome for study right as it transitioned from republic to empire
                under Caesar Augustus. It provides insights into early political nationalism and
                means of classical propoganda. 1500 years later, artists of the Italian Renaissance
                viewed ancient Rome as the origin of Italian art and civilization, and the
                    The <em>Aeneid</em> became the feature of Renaissance painting, carving, and
                sculpture, emulating Hellenistic works such as the famous Greek statue of "Laocoon
                and His Sons", which despicts an event of book two. Lastly, the <em>Aeneid</em> is
                of particular interest to linguists, as Vergil attempted to emulate the antiquated
                Homeric style through the transition from Greek to Latin. Thus, later reproductions
                and translations become somewhat of a second-stage reflection, attempting to write
                in archaic forms of their own language.</p>
            <p> As a result of its popularity and cultural relevancy, the <em>Aeneid</em> has been
                translated into many common languages, some of which are far different from the
                original Latin. For this project, we examined primarily the Spanish, German, and
                English translations as well as the original Latin. We were partially limited to
                these by the language proficiencies of the researchers involved, but we were able to
                observe a wide variety of etymological trends throughout this group. For example,
                Spanish is a close descendant of Latin within the Romance languages, while German is
                less related yet still retains some influence. English balances the two, both being
                a sister language to German and drawing large quantities of its vocabulary from
                Latinate and Romance roots. This raises the question, how do translators address the
                varying artistic intricacies of each language.</p>
            <p> The object of our research project is this: what linguistic changes are made across
                translations with regards to grammatical structures and figurative language? We wish
                to observe how different translations accommodate poetic and grammatical structures
                that may not exist in the original form or seek to replicate them in their own
                language. Some examples of what we looked for are verb forms and usage, the
                consistency of tenses, the emulation of sound devices and figurative speech, and
                overall word count.</p>
            <p> With the epic consisting of twelve books, each containing several hundred lines, our
                research selected key passages of the work to focus on, acting as microcosms for the
                entire piece. Of this, we chose Aeneas’ speech to his men in book one, the passage
                of Laocoon and the snakes before the sacking of Troy in book two, and Queen Dido’s
                suicide and release by the goddess Iris in book four. These were selected because
                they provide examples from across a broad range of the epic's length and are
                commonly renowned in the academic setting as being particularly strong
                demonstrations of Virgil's artistry through their use of sound devices, poetic
                stylings, and beautiful depictions. Additionally, together they employ a diversity
                of grammatical functions, which allowed us to analyze the translations of different
                tenses and voices rather than to merely observe continuous sections maintaining the
                same grammatical style.</p>
